# ## Does the Indian stock market react to the transition risk of climate change?

# Through this project, we intend to analyze the reaction of the Indian stock market to global climate-related conferences and news. We have used a **top-down approach** to study the same. Starting from the impact on the overall stock market indices, we break it down further by studying the major industry drivers of that impact through an economic analysis.

# ##### We focus on the most significant climate-related events that took place between the period of 2011 and 2022.
# The significance of the COPs was decided on the basis of the negotiations that went on in that particular conference and whether the nations were successful in coming to a common consensus on its objectives. Additionally, the US withdrawal decision from the Paris Agreement has been considered as it altered the potential impact of the previously ratified agreement.
