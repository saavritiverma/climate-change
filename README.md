# climate-change
A beginner level project created by two economics students enthused by climate change and its impact on the world.
Simerleen and Saavriti met at the Delhi School of Economics because of their shared discipline and became companions in everything academics and beyond. Inspired by their intriguing lectures on climate change economics, and to exercise their ongoing endeavor of learning Python, they worked on this project together. 
The project intends to study the reaction of the Indian stock market to the most significant global Conference of Parties (COPs) and some other climate-related events, through a top-down approach.
